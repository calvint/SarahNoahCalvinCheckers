# SarahNoahCalvinCheckers
This is the submission for Noah, Sarah, and Calvin.

We basically just copied over the Connect4 Code. We have the check to break after 2 seconds in our Strategy, yet the first move still takes 3+ seconds according to the printout. Not sure why?

We get this output when running StrategyA vs itself:
